        <li><b>Robotic vehicle controlled through touch screen-based device.</b></li>
        <pre>Amount-7999/-</pre>
<p>This is the incredible final year project for ECE engineering used to design the robotic vehicle that can be utilized to control the android based device. The project also uses a robot, and based on the input here, the touchscreen-based device is utilized.</p>
    <li><b>Coal mine system for safety alerting and monitoring</b></li>
    <pre>Amount-8999/-</pre>
    <p>The procedure to remove coal from the underground is recognized as coal mining, and different companies like steel, cement, and more use the fuel similar to coal. In the mining industries, distinct everyday parameters can also be monitored like methane gas, temperature, fire, etc.</p>
    <li><b>IoT-based home automation system</b></li>
    <pre>Amount-9999/-</pre>
    <p>The Home automation system based on Internet of Things is another topic for final year projects for ECE engineering that is utilized to remotely control home appliances with the help of the Internet.</p>
    <li><b>Design of Low-Power SRAM</b></li>
    <p>Develop an SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) circuit with reduced power consumption, targeting energy-efficient applications such as IoT devices.
    <li><b>FPGA-based Image Recognition</b></li>
    <p>Implement an image recognition system on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), utilizing popular algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time object detection.</p>
    <li><b>Energy Harvesting for Wearable Devices</b></li>
    <li><b>Distance measurement using Image processing</b></li>
    <p>The technique about measurement distance measurement using image processing between vehicles to vehicles. The systems can be compared i.e.; with data stored in the database as reference.</p>
